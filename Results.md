# Methods
* This experiment evaluates the experience of the users using the Constable application. 
* Google Forms were used for getting feedback from the users.
* Since this application required permission for GitHub access, the users were asked about the how comfortable they were to give this access.
* The users were asked to fill out metrics for ease of use, readability, satisfaction and badge. 
* They were also asked to list the challenges they faced along with the things they liked and disliked about the application. 
* A google doc was created with instructions of how to run the application and with the feedback form.

# Materials
* Github
* Google Forms
* Cloud web hosting service - Heroku
* Communication Channel - Slack
* Google Docs


# Observations
### Safety Use
![Safe use](https://github.com/bhavesh242/constable-github-action/blob/main/assets/Q1.JPG)

From the pie chart we can see that 50% of the subjects did not find the application safe to use. One possible reason for this could be that the application requires requires permission for GitHub access and people are not very comfortable giving access of their GitHub account to a third party application. The subjects might have missed the fact that OAuth is used for authentication which ensures security. The other half of the subjects found the application fairly safe.

### Ease of use

From the above chart, we observe that the application seems to be pretty easy to use as all the subjects found it moderate to very easy to use. In addition, 60% of the subjects found it very easy to use. This is expected because the application is just a click away and subjects had enough knowledge to use GitHub and new applications, hence the subjects might have found it easy to use.


### Readablility

### Likeliness of Adding Constable Badge to User's Repository

From the stats above, it can be seen that there is a divided opinion on adding the constable badge to the repository. This is most probably because half of the users that want to add constable bagdge like the idea of constable and it's scoring whereas the other half of the users do not necessarily agree with the scoring formula's followed by the application. Some users may also not find the contable badge relevant to be added to their respective readme files.

# Threats to Validity
- The experiments were performed on only 10 subjects, which is very small sample space and hence we might not draw reliable conclusions.
- Since the subjects were from CSC510 class, they could be from same team and they might have tested the application using their common repositories resulting in duplicate observations.
- The subjects were all graduate student with mostly similar background/experience, hence results could be biased. Instead, if the sample space had (say) 3 college grads, 3 professors and 4 industry level specialists, our results would have been different and much more plausible given the diversity of the subjects.
-  The experiment was conducted asynchronously, hence subject might have filled the form without actually performing the experiment.
- It is possible that the subjects might have tested only repositories of similar quality and formed an opinion on the application resulting in misleading conclusions.
