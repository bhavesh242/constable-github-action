# Methods
* This experiment evaluates the experience of the users using the Constable application. 
* Google Forms were used for getting feedback from the users.
* Since this application required permission for GitHub access, the users were asked about the how comfortable they were to give this access.
* The users were asked to fill out metrics for ease of use, readability, satisfaction and badge. 
* They were also asked to list the challenges they faced along with the things they liked and disliked about the application. 
* A google doc was created with instructions of how to run the application and with the feedback form.
